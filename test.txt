My God, I'm so lonely, so I open the window
To hear sounds of people
To hear sounds of people
Venus, planet of love, was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much, too?
Did its people want too much?
And I don't want your pity, I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward, I just want to feel alright
And I know no one will save me, I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss and I'll be alright
