1.  Test Environment:
        Docker shell with Ubuntu, then downloaded Dev Containers on host computer's (Mac running MAC OS Sequoia 15.6.1)
        Visual Studio Code, which allowed to edit the code from with Visual Studio Code.
2. Group Members:
    Spencer Conrad-Got the idea to find out how to edit code in VS Code from him, and then looked up how to do,
        as using a GUI was easier than VIM(which I am unfamilar with)
    Hanieh Ajami-Talked about implementing part 4

    Research:
        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/ls-command-in-linux/
3. Additional Info:
    I do not believe any additional info is needed to run the implementation.  I have screenshots of code, make qemu-nox
    in terminal command line, and output in the xv6 shell of each part.  For part 2, I could not implement sorting or adding "/" to directories.

4.  Specific Questions:
        Part 3 question:
            Instances of getpid - 6 instances counted in make clean environment:
                syscall.c   syscall.h
                sysproc.c
                user.h
                usertests.c     
                usys.S
